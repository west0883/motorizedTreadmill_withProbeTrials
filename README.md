# motorizedTreadmill_withProbeTrials

This code runs a stepper motor at variable speeds and durations with an Anduino Due microcontroller in locomotion experiements in mice. Warning tones are included as a cue stimulus. Optional "probe" trials create a mismatch between the warning cue and the subsequent action of the motor as control trials. This code is designed for use by the Ebner Lab at the University of Minnesota.

This code calls on libraries included in the list of installable libraries available with the standard Arduino IDE software. Credit belongs to the original creators of each part of this code and should be cited accordingly.
